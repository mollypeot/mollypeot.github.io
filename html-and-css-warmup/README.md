# HTML & CSS warmup

## DUE DATE: Friday, Sept. 25, 2015

Let's shake off the rust with an exercise.

The purpose of this mini site build is to let you re-familiarize yourself with HTML and CSS. You should strive to create a nice design and utilize best practices for the web.

How you approach this is up to you. You may want to do a wireframe or sketches. I am most concerned with seeing where we can improve your current coding skill set or discuss design choices.


### REQUIREMENTS

All the content necessary to build this site is included in this repo.

- Each .txt file should have its own web page. All content needs to be used in some way. Some content may be re-used across the site.

- Use of images is required except where noted as optional (`sprockets.png` is included as an optional design element).

- Your site should be organized using a proper site architecture (i.e. `.css` in a `css` directory; `.jpg`, `.png` in an `images` directory).

- Site navigation should exhibit elements of interactivity. Think about `:visited` and `:hover` link states. (I don't want to see boring, default blue-and-purple links! :} )

- One page must include a form (see "Something New").

- Exhibits best practices for the web and good design choices.

Otherwise, you have artistic freedom to create the site as you see fit. If you come across design elements you have permission to use (i.e. they are not copyrighted), you may incorporate them into your design.

But please, really, don't overthink this. It's *practice*.


### SOMETHING NEW

We don't cover HTML Forms in JMM 341. Without Javascript or back-end processing, there's little reason to have a form on a web site.

In this class, though, forms are necessary to interact with the user. So this will be our first experience with HTML forms. If you know how to use HTML tags, you should have no problem creating a non-functional form. :)

On the "Contact Us" page, build out the form to fit into your design.

- Use text fields for the name, address, phone, email, etc.
- Create a pulldown menu for the industry choices
- Create checkboxes for the product choices
- Use radio buttons for the "quarterly catalog" opt-in
- Include a submit button


### RETROSPECTIVE

Please include a short (250-300 words â€” *shorter than this document!*) noting the areas you felt a little uncomfortable with and might want some clarification.

If you're a *wizard* and don't run into any problems, then write about the choices you made with design or code. Let's have some insight into your work.


### GRADING

This qualifies as a "weekly" exercise, but you will have more than a week to complete it. Please make sure submit the files to GitHub by the above date for credit. There's no penalty for submitting this early.

This isn't about perfection. It is an opportunity to refresh your skills. I am looking for an honest effort. I do not want to see a last-minute, shoddy, rush job. This is why I ask for the retrospective. If you truly struggled, I expect your commentary to address a lot of areas which need clarification.

### FINAL WORD

Do not hesitate to ask questions if you have them. Again, this is a practice exercise to let *you* discover what you know and don't know. It is also okay to experiment; if you fail to pull off an idea, just note it in the retrospective.

Have fun. :)
